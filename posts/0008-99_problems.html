<p>In spirit of the world cup live blogs, I want to try to broadcast my attempt to solve the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions/1_to_10">“99 Questions”</a> in Haskell today. I’m going to go at the problems for the next 8 hours, until 8 p.m. western time, with breaks in between to eat and watch the world cup finals! Solutions to the problems will be pushed to <a href>this git repository</a>.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<hr />
<p>06:23 PM Maybe an hour an 23 minutes. Let’s do some binary tree actions</p>
<p>05:00 PM Going to take an hour break.</p>
<p>04:26 PM I’m done with lists now… will try some binary tree problems instead.</p>
<p>04:01 PM I think I’m developing a new style.. consider the solution to problem 17</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">split (x<span class="fu">:</span>xs) n 
  <span class="fu">|</span> n <span class="fu">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">let</span> (f,l) <span class="fu">=</span> split xs (n<span class="fu">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>) <span class="kw">in</span> (x<span class="fu">:</span>f, l)  jk)</code></pre>
<p>the <code>let</code> style is pretty useful..</p>
<p>03:37 PM Skipping problem 13.. getting tired of that set of question.. Onward!</p>
<p>03:17 PM A set of ten is complete! Time to commit</p>
<p>02:51 PM Kudos for germany!</p>
<p>02:21 PM Problem 8 was more interesting then I though. So the init value of foldr is more important than I thought 12:50 PM Worldcup + lunch time!! First 6 problems are really a warm-up problems. But I’ve not been making good times..</p>
<p>12:41 PM Skipping prob 7… There are complications with this problem that I am not really interested in looking into.</p>
<p>12:06 PM Spent some time setting up a testing environment. Never used HUnit before, but it seems pretty straightforward. But was this really worth my time? haha</p>
<hr />
<p>Alright, I must admit this was a failed attempt at doing something quite nerdy and pretty sweet. Unfortunate how this turned out to be :(.</p>
