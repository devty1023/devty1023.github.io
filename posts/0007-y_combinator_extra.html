<p>On my <a href="http://blog.2t.io/posts/0002-y_combinator_pt1.html">previous explorations on y-combinator</a>, I had considered y-combinator as a function that spews out fixpoint value of for a given function. We tried (but stopped short) of deriving a y-combinator with a clear goal in sight - to come up with a non-explicit recursive definition for a factorial function.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to think wonder about the limit of y-combinators. What is the <em>domain</em> of this amazing little guy - does y-combinator work for any type of function or some subset of function with a particular quality?</p>
<p>I had ignored the thought at the time, but the question came up again while I was reading a <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/?post_type=publication&amp;p=111">paper on the history of of functional programming</a>. It seems necessary to answer the question to further my understanding of y-combinator.</p>
<h2 id="lambda-calculus">lambda calculus</h2>
<p>y-combinator is a artifact of lambda calculus, a branch of mathematics functional programming owes a lot to. I take lambda calculus as a yet another system to describe how the universe operates, and it produces some awesome results that is quite fun to think about.</p>
<p>One of the result of lambda calculus is the <em>fixpoint theroem</em>:</p>
<pre><code>Every lambda expression e has a fixpoint e' such taht (e e') &lt;=&gt; e'</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty powerful statement since it is so easy think of a function in calculus that has no fixpoint (say <code>f(x) = x + 1</code>). The proof of the statment is quite short - I copy down the proof in verbatim from the aforementioned paper:</p>
<pre><code>Proof: Take e' to be (Y e) where Y, known as the Y combinator, 
       is defined by
                    Y = λf.(λx.f(x x))(λx.f(x x))
       then
                (Y e) = (λx.e(x x))(λx.e(x x))
                      = e(λx.e(x x))(λx.e(x x))
                      = e(Y e)
  
       so
                  e'  = e e'
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty cool. For one, the proof is almost trivial. Two, the proof is trivial because we were able to find this amazing little entity named y-combinator in the universe created in lambda calculus.</p>
<p>Looking at y-combinator as this mystic creature of immense grace and utility is a more amusing. I mean, yes someone (namely Church) must have known what they were looking for and came up with a systematic way of deriving y-combinator (as we tried to do in the other post). But to think that we can define a set of axioms for our mathematical unvierse and see this beauty emerge from it - I can almost relate to God and the love for his creations.</p>
<p>I’ll finish up this romantic post with another verbatim copy from the aforementioned paper to describe how we can use y-combinator to define recursive functions:</p>
<pre><code>Consider recursive function f defined by:
 
          f = ····f····
 
This could be rewritten as
 
          f = (λf.····f····)f

where note that the inner occurence of f is now bound.
This equation essentially says that f is a fixedpoint of
the lambda expression (λf.····f····) - but that is
exactly what Y computes for us, so we arrive at the 
following non-recursive definition for f:

          f = Y (λf.····f····)</code></pre>
