<p>For my introduction into the world of functional programming, I’ve been relying on the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/">course webpage</a> for UPenn’s CIS194: Introduction to Haskell. It’s really a fine collection of articles and exercises curated by <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/">Brent Yorgey</a>. Pretty awesome guy - I need to make sure I reach out to him and send him my appreciation when I finish his online modules.</p>
<p>I just finished the modules for week 10 and 11 this weekend and will probably conclude the course with a module on Monads by the end of this week. It’s been almost an addictive ride - when was I ever excited to dive into the homework set to see what treat the instructor had prepared for me this week? Sometimes, I would even go forward to the next module even though I needed to spend more time grasping the current one - “Eh I’m not sure if I intuitively understand functors…but wait I gotta read these articles about applicative functors!!!” Pretty nerdy stuff.</p>
<p>I think Haskell really struck chords with me because it would not stop impressing me with wonderful concepts it encompasses. It was like the abstract algebra or discrete mathematics course I had really enjoyed back in college - unending presentation of some beautiful concepts that one had never imagined existed - but even more excellent because I can physically play with the idea using my handy dandy command line. What a treat it was - a thousand shout-out to Brent for his awesome exercises.</p>
<p>For the course’s final assignment, Brent gives few options to the students, one of the being making a non-trivial contribution to an open source project. I actually have been wanting to do exactly that for a while and had in my to make a contribution to <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">hakyll</a>, the blogging platform that powers this website. Hakyll itself is made to be ultra-configurable, and it seemed to me that the consensus of the its user-base is to keep it that way - in other words, the contributions they seek probably aren’t some feature candy for the platform. But I do wish there were more batteries that comes included with the platform, or at least a central place where people share some of the nifty features they had set up for their hakyll-based website. Ideas..ideas..</p>
<p>Anyhow, what an entertainment it was to go through CIS194. My solutions to the exercises <a href="https://github.com/devty1023/cis194">lives in github</a>, although it might be pulled down if Brent does not want it public (because he should definitely recycle his awesomes exercises). Back to reading the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a> and reading about Monads to conclude the course!</p>
